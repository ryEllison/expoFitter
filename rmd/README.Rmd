# Overview

**expoFitter** is a specialized tool for visualizing and fitting non-linear electrophysiological data, built using R, shiny, and flexdashboard. Designed to model slow neuronal currents like the calcium-dependent potassium current ($I_{KCa}$), **expoFitter** provides robust methodologies for fitting and analyzing current kinetics through single- and double-exponential models. This allows researchers to extract time constants and assess model fitness, giving insight into current dynamics. While expoFitter does not directly measure intracellular calcium ($[Ca^{2+}]_i$) dynamics, the tool's modeling logic and uncovered temporal information has been effectively used as an indirect measure of $[Ca^{2+}]_i$ changes in neurons of the lobster pyloric network, as demonstrated in ongoing research (Ellison et al., _in progress_; Thuma et al., _in progress_). The tool's robust non-linear least squares optimization makes it highly effective for studying slow electrophysiological processes.

# Tool Features

- **Data Preprocessing and Filtering**: Incorporates a unique data wrangling/filtering algorithm that utilizes both finite and simple differentiation to extract salient parts of the current trace, ensuring accurate and reliable model fits. This preprocessing step is essential for isolating active portions of the current.

- **Native Model Parameter Approximator**: Integrates approximator functionality automating model initial-conditional estimates based on quintessential features of the experimental data. Given the robustness of the optimizer, this reduces the need for manual adjustment of these parameters by the user.

- **Flexible and Robust Exponential Model Fitting**: Supports both single- and double-exponential model fits using the `nlsLM` algorithm from the `minpack.lm` package. The `nlsLM` algorithm implements the _Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm_, which combines gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton method for robust non-linear least squares optimization (see Supplemental Information below). The application fits experimental data using the following exponential models:
    
  - **Single-Exponential Model**: 
  
  $$I = A e^{-\frac{t}{B}} + C$$
  
  - **Double-Exponential Model**: 
  
  $$I = A e^{-\frac{t}{B}} + C e^{-\frac{t}{D}} + E$$

  where $B$ and $D$ represent the time constants of the first and second phase of the exponential curve, respectively.

- **Interactive Visualization and Model Parameter Adjustment**: Provides a fully interactive interface for data visualization and model fitting, enabling users to dynamically adjust model parameters through sliders and observe the resultant model solution both quantitatively and visually.

# Installation

### **expoFitter** Locally

There are several ways to access **expoFitter**. If you want the entirety of the repository, you can clone it to your local machine using these _terminal_ commands (_terminal_ used generically throughout):

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ryEllison/expoFitter.git
  cd expoFitter
  ```
Ensure you are in the desired directory before executing the terminal commands. You can also use a point-and-click approach by navigating to _Code_ in Github and selecting _Download ZIP_. Downloading **expoFitter** this way will require your moving expoFitter from your local Downloads to the desired location on your machine. 

To run **expoFitter** locally, ensure that `R` is installed on your system, as well as the following packages:

- `dplyr 1.1.4`
- `minpack.lm 1.2.4`
- `DT 0.33`
- `shiny 1.9.1`

and your system's environmental variables provide terminal access to `R`'s interpreter `Rscript`. Package installation is automated and can be completed by running the `install_dependencies` pseudo-executable in the `\bin` directory. 

**expoFitter** can then be deployed utilizing your machine as a local server via the `expoFitter_R` pseudo-executable in the `\bin` directory. To make any tweaks or alterations to the tool to fit your particular use case, the code is dispersed throughout appropriate directories (e.g., `\app`, `\scripts`, and `\src`).

### **expoFitter** as Electron App

**expoFitter** has also been built as a portable, desktop `Electron` app. The `Electron` build can be found in the `\electron` directory. However, for access to the desktop app the `\installer` directory can be downloaded using this terminal approach:

  ```bash
  git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/ryEllison/expoFitter.git
  cd expoFitter
  git sparse-checkout init --cone
  git sparse-checkout set ./installer
  git checkout master
  cd installer
  pseudo_installer.bat
  ```
Again, ensuring you are in the directory where you wish the installer to be placed before executing the terminal commands. 

You can also use a point-and-click approach and directly download the installer using the hyperlink below:

[Installer]()

Downloading **expoFitter** this way will require your moving the installer from your local downloads to the desired location on your machine before executing the `pseudo-installer` pseudo-executable.

### **expoFitter** on shinyapps.io

Lastly, **expoFitter** has been made publicly available as a web app, which is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), and can be accessed using [https://ryellison.shinyapps.io/expofitter/](https://ryellison.shinyapps.io/expofitter/).

<!-- # Usage -->

<!-- ### Data Input -->

<!-- - Upload a `.csv` file containing time and current data. Ensure that the file has at least two columns: -->
<!--     - Column 1: Time (in seconds) -->
<!--     - Column 2: Current (in nanoamps) -->

<!-- ### Model Initialization -->

<!-- - **Select Model**: Choose between a 'Single-Exponential,' 'Double-Exponential,' or 'Both' models from the dropdown menu. -->
<!-- - **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to set initial values for model parameters (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, etc.). -->

<!-- ### Visualization and Fitting -->

<!-- - **Visualize Data**: The app plots the input current vs. time data automatically. -->
<!-- - **Fit Model**: Click the 'Fit Model' button to apply the selected model to the data and visualize the fitted curve. -->

<!-- ### Saving Results -->

<!-- - Once the model fitting is complete, you can save the resulting plot as a `.pdf` file by clicking the 'Save' button in the interface. -->

<!-- ### Output -->

<!-- - Model parameters, R² values, and fitting summaries are displayed in the 'Model Solution' section, providing quantitative feedback on the model's performance. -->

# Supplemental Information

## **Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm** 

Update rule:

$$\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \left( \mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{J} + \lambda \mathbf{I} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{r}$$

Where:
  
  - $\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the residuals,
  - $\mathbf{r}$ is the residual vector (differences between observed and predicted data),
  - $\lambda$ is a damping factor that controls the transition between gradient descent (for stability) and the Gauss-Newton method (for faster convergence).

### **Gradient Descent** (when $\lambda$ is large) 

Update rule:
  
$$\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \alpha \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k)$$
    
Where: 

  - $\alpha$ is the learning rate,
  - $\nabla F$ is the gradient of the cost function.

### **Gauss-Newton Method** (when $\lambda$ is small) 

Update rule:
  
$$\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \left( \mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{J} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{r}$$

These methods ensure high-fidelity parameter estimation for complex neuroelectrophysiological datasets.
