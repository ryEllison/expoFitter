# Overview

**expoFitter** is a Shiny-based application designed for the analysis and modeling of electrophysiological data, with a focus on current vs. time traces commonly encountered in neuroscience research. The app provides tools for data visualization, preprocessing, and fitting of both single- and double-exponential models. This facilitates the study of dynamic processes in neuronal systems, such as ionic currents, calcium dynamics, or neural network behavior.

The application includes backend functions for filtering data, computing coefficients of determination (R²), and fitting models using non-linear least squares optimization. Additionally, the app provides an intuitive, interactive interface for setting model parameters and visualizing fitted models.

# Features

- **Data Filtering**: Employs finite differences and simple differences to filter noise from experimental data.
- **Exponential Model Fitting**: Supports single- and double-exponential model fitting using the `nlsLM` algorithm.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualizes raw data and fitted models with dynamic slider inputs to adjust fitting parameters.
- **Flexible UI**: User-friendly interface powered by R Shiny and `flexdashboard` for flexible, customizable data exploration.

# Installation

To run the `expoFitter` application locally, ensure that R is installed on your system along with the following packages:

- `dplyr`
- `minpack.lm`
- `DT`
- `shiny`

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/expoFitter.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd expoFitter
    ```

3. Open R or RStudio and install the required packages:
    ```r
    install.packages(c('dplyr', 'minpack.lm', 'DT', 'shiny'))
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```r
    shiny::runApp('path/to/repository')
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy the app directly from RStudio using the `Run App` button.

# Usage

### Data Input

- Upload a `.csv` file containing time and current data. Ensure that the file has at least two columns:
    - Column 1: Time (in seconds)
    - Column 2: Current (in nanoamps)

### Model Initialization

- **Select Model**: Choose between a 'Single-Exponential,' 'Double-Exponential,' or 'Both' models from the dropdown menu.
- **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to set initial values for model parameters (`A`, `B`, `C`, etc.).

### Visualization and Fitting

- **Visualize Data**: The app plots the input current vs. time data automatically.
- **Fit Model**: Click the 'Fit Model' button to apply the selected model to the data and visualize the fitted curve.

### Saving Results

- Once the model fitting is complete, you can save the resulting plot as a `.pdf` file by clicking the 'Save' button in the interface.

### Output

- Model parameters, R² values, and fitting summaries are displayed in the 'Model Solution' section, providing quantitative feedback on the model's performance.
